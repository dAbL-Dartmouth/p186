For binomial logistic classification, use the following three scripts
#***********************

#-----------------------
1. predClassBinary_biophysical.R
Takes about 5 min to complete
#-----------------------
===> This script performs binomial logistic classification to identify vaccine groups using the biophysical measurements
		(1) Classification is done using the lasso-regularized binomial logistic regression on the features. The best regularization parameter (lambda) is chosen to be the one with lowest classification error. This is repeated multiple times. A final model is trained and evaluated by using a fixed seed to determine folds.
		(2) Permutation tests are performed by shuffling the rows of the class labels, but keeping the rows of feature matrix the same. The permuted data are sent through the same pipeline as were the actual data. This is repeated multiple times, independently permuting the class labels every time.
		(3) Robustness is estimated by comparing the accuracies from using actual features to those of using permuted features.

#***********************
For generating the figures as in the manuscript, graphpad prism was used to plot output data
